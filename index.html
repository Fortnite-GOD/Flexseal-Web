            <p>Flex Seal family of products has been partnered with Xfinity for about 5 years. Since 2013, we have had many racers drive the Flex Seal racecar
                like Ross Chastain, Landon Cassill, and Jeffery Earnhardt. In 2017, Garrett Smithley was driving the Flex Seal racecar, when all the sudden he 
                got into a minor accident. It was okay though, since we had Flex Tape to help out. We put Flex Tape on the racecar and it kept riding on. 
                This truely shows you the power of Flex Seal products and the power of JD Motorsports.
