                <p> Flex Seal has been a succesful ultilty tool that you could use for anything, but now there's Flex Seal Liquid
                    to make Flex Seal even more useful. Flex Seal Liquid is a storng, thicc rubbery liquid that can fill in cracks
                    an seal them well. Flex Seal liquid is so thick that it doesn't go through netting as much as regualar paint.
                    Flex Seal Liquid is actually a liquid rubber that after some time in the air will dry out and become a rubbery slab.
                    This means if you want things like a no-slip grip for your tools, you could just dip the handle in Flex Seal Liquid.
                    Flex Seal Liquid is powerful that it can even make an airboat waterproof and work in water. There's just so much
                    that you can do with Flex Seal Liquid, and they even come in four colours of clear, white, black and gray.
